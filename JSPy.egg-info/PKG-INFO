        ===================
        
        Run JavaScript through Python
        -----------------------------
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To use this library, you must first install the library
        (``pip3 install JSPy``)
        
        In your code, you must import JSPy package by including ``import JSPy``.
        
        To execute JavaScript, use the command ``JSPy.exec(JAVASCRIPT_STRING)``,
        where the ``JAVASCRIPT_STRING`` is the JavaScript you would like to run.
        This will automatically run the file and return anything that the system
        returns.
        
        If you would like to execute a JavaScript File, use the command
        ``print(JSPy.exec("FILE", "file"))``, where ``FILE`` is the filename.
        This will automatically run the file and return anything that the system
        returns. If an error is thrown relating to the filename, you may have to
        include the file path.
        
        Common Errors
        -------------
        
        If you get a JavaScript Runtime Error, you can use the following
        commands:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           sudo apt-get install npm
           sudo apt-get install nodejs
        
        If you do not have sudo permissions, you can use the following commands:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.25.0/install.sh | bash
           nvm install stable
           nvm alias default stable
        
        If you are using a Windows Computer/Server, download ``nodejs`` from
        `https://nodejs.org/ <https://nodejs.org/en/>`__. You may have to
        restart your computer/server for this to be configured.
